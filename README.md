Super apps (aka Everything Apps) are getting more popular these days.
This also means to interact with people migrated to a super app, you also have to have the same super app.
Also means everyone have to hand their data to a single centralized server.
Or rather, this was like that.
If you want to interact with someone from different super app and both apps are compatible with **TheProtocols**, you can interact as you are in using the same super app.

**TheProtocols**, aka **PGDv3.x**, is a federated protocol for decentralizing super apps by letting people choose a network and a client they want.
TheProtocols is designed to provide most functionality a standard user needs in a daily life.
Only super app functionality that is not planned is social media.
As the developer of TheProtocols, I want to let people decide their choice of social media instead of turning it to a standard.
There is plenty of decentralized social media protocols, some of them are federalized while some of them are distributed.
Choice must be up to the user.

### Quick Start Guide

If you want to start using TheProtocols immediately, you can choose a network from [network directory](Directory/Networks.md) and a client from [client directory](Directory/Clients.md).

If you want to host your own network, you can choose a server software from [server software directory](Directory/Server-Softwares.md) and follow introductions of the server software you chose.
Then you can use your network with any client.
If you want your network to be listed in [the directory](Directory/Networks.md), follow instructions located at the end of the directory.

If you want to create your own server software, client or other software using TheProtocols, follow [Guide](Guide/README.md) for details about development with TheProtocols.
