Super apps (aka Everything Apps) are getting more popular these days.
This also means to interact with people migrated to a super app, you also have to have the same super app.
Also means everyone have to hand their data to a single centralized server.
Or rather, this was like that.
If you want to interact with someone from different super app and both apps are compatible with **TheProtocols**, you can interact as you are in using the same super app.

**TheProtocols**, aka **PGDv3**, is a federated protocol for decentralizing super apps by letting people choose a network and a client they want.
TheProtocols is designed to provide most functionality a standard user needs in a daily life.
TheProtocols will be extended to provide more functionality in time as TheProtocols 3.1 is already under heavy development by the time TheProtocols released.
Only super app functionality that is not planned is social media.
As the developer of TheProtocols, I want to let people decide their choice of social media instead of turning it to a standard.
There is plenty of decentralized social media protocols, some of them are federalized while some of them are distributed.
Choice must be up to the user.

### Quick Start Guide

If you want to start using TheProtocols immediately, you can choose a network from [network directory](Directory/Networks.md) and a client from [client directory](Directory/Clients.md).

If you want to host your own network, you can choose a server software from [server software directory](Directory/Server-Softwares.md) and follow introductions of the server software you chose.
Then you can use your network with any client.
If you want your network to be listed in [the directory](Directory/Networks.md), follow instructions located at the end of the directory.

If you want to create your own server software, client or other software using TheProtocols, follow [Guide](Guide/README.md) for details about development with TheProtocols.
