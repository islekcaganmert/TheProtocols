### What Differences a Non-technical User Except?
Absolutely nothing but seeing **Advanced** buttons on some pages including sign in, sign up, or verification.
If you are using a client by a developer, a team, or a company have a network or an agreement with a network, you are most likely to see that network selected by default.
This provides an experience nearly identical to centralized apps.

### Why Federalized, Not Distributed?

Distributed protocols are working in a way relay admins can see your data if the developer of relay's software wrote bad code.
But you can think same security concern is here for federalized protocols but there is a difference.
Distributed protocols are giving your data to multiple relays even you host your own relay.
In federalized protocols, you can host your server to keep your data to yourself.
If you can't host your own server, there is a great chance to find a reliable server.

### Can Distributed Network Be Integrated?

Of course and I am willing to help if someone wants to implement.
There can be two layers of network.
Clients can connect with a bridge that connects to multiple relays, checks blockchain, and handles extra encryption for privacy.
And this is why networks are not basically called servers, networks can be a single server, multiple servers working together, or even a web3 network.
Possibilities are limited only with the imagination.
